<h1>ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Continuous Delivery of a Java Web Application ðŸš€</h1>

Iâ€™ve successfully implemented a Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline for a Java web application, automating the build, test, and deployment process using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS. Hereâ€™s how it works:

ðŸ”¹ **Jenkins Pipeline**: Defined a fully automated CI/CD pipeline in a `Jenkinsfile` to build, test, containerize, and deploy the application.

ðŸ”¹ **Docker Containerization**: Used Docker to containerize the Java web application, making it portable and easily deployable across different environments.

ðŸ”¹ **AWS Deployment**: The pipeline deploys the application to an AWS ECS cluster (or Kubernetes) for staging and production environments. It also includes a manual approval step before production deployment.

ðŸ”¹ **Slack Notifications**: Integrated Slack to notify the team of build and deployment status, ensuring transparency throughout the development process.

This project demonstrates in setting up automated CD pipelines and delivering high-quality software faster and more reliably.

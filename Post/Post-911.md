<h1>ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Continuous Integration on Azure Cloud ðŸš€</h1>

I recently implemented a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline on Microsoft Azure for a Java web application. Hereâ€™s an overview of the setup:

ðŸ”¹ **Azure DevOps**: Used Azure DevOps Pipelines to automate the entire build and testing process.
  
ðŸ”¹ **Azure Repos**: The source code is hosted on Azure Repos, with every push automatically triggering the pipeline.

ðŸ”¹ **Maven Build and Tests**: Configured Maven in the pipeline to build the Java web application and run unit tests, ensuring the code is reliable and deployable.

ðŸ”¹ **Azure App Service / AKS Deployment**: 
   - The application is containerized using Docker and deployed to Azure App Service (or Kubernetes via AKS) automatically.
   - Each successful build can be deployed to staging, with optional approval for production deployment.

ðŸ”¹ **Real-time Notifications**: Integrated Azure DevOps with Slack to notify the team of every build and deployment status.

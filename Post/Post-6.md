<h1>ðŸš€ **Project Showcase: Containerizing a Java Application with Docker** ðŸš€</h1>

I recently completed a project to containerize a Java (Spring Boot) application using Docker, streamlining the deployment process and ensuring consistency across environments. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process:

ðŸ”¹ **Dockerfile Creation**: Wrote a Dockerfile to define the applicationâ€™s environment, specifying a lightweight OpenJDK base image, copying the applicationâ€™s JAR file, exposing necessary ports, and defining the entry point.

ðŸ”¹ **Image Building**: Used Maven to build a custom image containing the entire application stack, encapsulating everything the application needs to run.

ðŸ”¹ **Container Deployment**: Ran the Docker container locally, mapping ports to allow access to the application via `http://localhost:8080`.

ðŸ”¹ **Registry Integration**: (Optional) Pushed the Docker image to a Docker Hub repository for easy sharing and deployment in different environments.


This project highlights the power of Docker in modernizing the deployment of Java applications, ensuring they run consistently on any platform, from development to production.

<h1>ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Continuous Delivery of Java Application on AWS Cloud ðŸš€</h1>

I successfully implemented a Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline for a Java application using AWS services. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

ðŸ”¹ **AWS CodePipeline**: Orchestrated the entire CD process, from code commit to deployment, ensuring an efficient and automated delivery pipeline.

ðŸ”¹ **AWS CodeBuild**: Integrated Maven to build the Java application and run tests, ensuring that only reliable code is deployed.

ðŸ”¹ **AWS Elastic Beanstalk / ECS**: The application is automatically deployed to **Elastic Beanstalk** for a managed environment, or **Amazon ECS** if containerized.

ðŸ”¹ **Dockerized**: Containerized the Java app using Docker, making it portable across different environments.

ðŸ”¹ **Monitoring & Rollback**: Implemented AWS CloudWatch to monitor performance, with automatic rollback configurations for safe deployments.

ðŸ”¹ **Real-time Notifications**: Set up SNS and Slack to notify the team of build and deployment statuses.



This project demonstrates my ability to implement a full Continuous Delivery pipeline on AWS, showcasing skills in automation, cloud-native architectures, and AWS services.

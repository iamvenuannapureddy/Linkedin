<h1>ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Lift and Shift Migration of Multi-Tier Web Application to AWS ðŸš€</h1>

I'm thrilled to share my recent project where I executed a **Lift and Shift** migration of a multi-tier web application to AWS. This project involved migrating a complex stack, including:

ðŸ”¹ **Frontend**: React.js hosted on S3 with CloudFront for global CDN delivery.

ðŸ”¹ **Backend**: Node.js/Express applications migrated to EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk for scalable deployment.

ðŸ”¹ **Databases**: MySQL migrated to RDS and MongoDB to MongoDB Atlas.

ðŸ”¹ **Web & App Servers**: NGINX and Apache Tomcat deployed on EC2 instances.

ðŸ”¹ **Caching & Messaging**: Integrated Elasticache (Memcached) and Amazon MQ (RabbitMQ) for improved performance.

ðŸ”¹ **Infrastructure Management**: Leveraged Vagrant, AWS CloudFormation, and Terraform for automated and scalable infrastructure provisioning.

**Highlights**:
- Successfully replicated on-premise infrastructure in AWS with minimal changes to the codebase.
  
- Enhanced performance and scalability using AWS Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and CloudFront.
  
- Implemented robust security measures including VPC, IAM roles, and encryption.
  
- Achieved cost optimization through careful resource management and monitoring.


This project underscores my expertise in cloud migrations, DevOps, and full-stack development. It also demonstrates my ability to leverage AWS's powerful features to enhance

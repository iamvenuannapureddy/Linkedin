I implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Java application using GitHub Actions. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

ðŸ”¹ **GitHub Actions**: Orchestrated the build, test, and deployment process directly from the GitHub repository.

ðŸ”¹ **Maven Build**: Automated the build process using Maven, with unit tests running after each push to the `main` branch.

ðŸ”¹ **AWS Elastic Beanstalk / ECS**: Deployed the application automatically to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** (or **Amazon ECS**), ensuring seamless delivery with every successful build.

ðŸ”¹ **Dockerized**: Used Docker to containerize the application for deployment on AWS ECS.

ðŸ”¹ **Slack Notifications**: Integrated Slack to notify the team about the build and deployment status, making the workflow highly transparent.

This project demonstrates my ability to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, making use of modern cloud services and containerization techniques for scalable, automated delivery.

 ðŸš€

I'm excited to share my recent project where I executed a **Lift and Shift** migration of a multi-tier web application to Microsoft Azure. This project involved migrating a complex stack, including:

ðŸ”¹ **Frontend**: React.js hosted on Azure Blob Storage with Azure CDN for global delivery.

ðŸ”¹ **Backend**: Node.js/Express applications migrated to Azure VMs and Azure App Service for scalable deployment.

ðŸ”¹ **Databases**: MySQL migrated to Azure Database for MySQL, and MongoDB to Cosmos DB.

ðŸ”¹ **Web & App Servers**: NGINX and Apache Tomcat deployed on Azure VMs.

ðŸ”¹ **Caching & Messaging**: Integrated Azure Cache for Redis and Azure Service Bus for improved performance.

ðŸ”¹ **Infrastructure Management**: Leveraged Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates and Terraform for automated and scalable infrastructure provisioning.

**Highlights**:
- **Seamless Migration**: Lifted and shifted the existing infrastructure with minimal changes, ensuring continuity in the cloud.
- **Enhanced Performance and Scalability**: Improved application performance with Azure Autoscale, Load Balancer, and CDN.
- **Robust Security**: Applied Azure security best practices, including VNets, NSGs, IAM, and encryption.
- **Cost Optimization**: Achieved cost efficiency by optimizing resource allocation and leveraging Azure's pay-as-you-go model.

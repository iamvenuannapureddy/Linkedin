<h1>ðŸš€ **Project Showcase: Jenkins Pipeline as Code for Java Application** ðŸš€</h1>

Iâ€™ve recently automated the CI/CD process of a Java application by implementing Jenkins Pipeline as Code using Groovy. This project ensures efficient, reproducible, and transparent builds, tests, and deployments. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown:

ðŸ”¹ **Jenkinsfile**: Defined the pipeline stages in a `Jenkinsfile`, including code checkout, build, test, Docker image creation, and deployment.

ðŸ”¹ **Pipeline Stages**:
   - **Checkout**: Pulls code from Git.
   - **Build**: Compiles the Java application using Maven.
   - **Test**: Runs unit tests to ensure code quality.
   - **Docker Image**: Builds and tags a Docker image using the applicationâ€™s version.
   - **Push Image**: Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.
   - **Deploy**: Deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster, updating the running services.

ðŸ”¹ **CI/CD Automation**: By defining the entire CI/CD process in code, weâ€™ve improved maintainability, version control, and scalability of the build process.


This project demonstrates my ability to automate complex build and deployment pipelines using Jenkins and Groovy.

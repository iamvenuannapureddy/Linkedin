<h1>Project-9: Continuous Integration on AWS Cloud</h1>

**Project Overview**:
In this project, we'll set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline on AWS using AWS-native services. The pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy a Java application using AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeDeploy. This setup is fully managed and scalable, making it ideal for cloud-native development.

### **Project Steps**:

1. **Set Up AWS CodeCommit**:
   - **Create a CodeCommit Repository**:
     - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to CodeCommit.
     - Create a new repository to store your applicationâ€™s source code.
     - Clone the repository to your local machine and push your existing codebase to CodeCommit.

2. **Set Up AWS CodeBuild**:
   - **Create a Build Project**:
     - Navigate to AWS CodeBuild and create a new build project.
     - **Source**: Select the CodeCommit repository as the source for the build.
     - **Environment**: 
       - Choose a managed image (e.g., Amazon Linux 2) with the required runtime environment (e.g., OpenJDK, Maven).
       - Set the environment variables if needed.
     - **Buildspec**:
       - You can either define the build commands in the console or include a `buildspec.yml` file in your source repository.

   - **Example `buildspec.yml`**:
     ```yaml
     version: 0.2

     phases:
       install:
         commands:
           - echo Installing Maven...
           - yum install -y maven
       pre_build:
         commands:
           - echo Pre-build started
           - mvn clean
       build:
         commands:
           - echo Build started
           - mvn package
       post_build:
         commands:
           - echo Build completed
           - mvn test

     artifacts:
       files:
         - target/myapp.jar
     ```

   **Explanation**:
   - **phases**: The build process is divided into phases: install, pre_build, build, and post_build.
   - **artifacts**: Specifies the files to be preserved as build artifacts.

3. **Set Up AWS CodePipeline**:
   - **Create a Pipeline**:
     - Go to AWS CodePipeline and create a new pipeline.
     - **Source Stage**:
       - Choose CodeCommit as the source provider.
       - Select the repository and branch that will trigger the pipeline.
     - **Build Stage**:
       - Choose CodeBuild as the build provider.
       - Select the CodeBuild project you created earlier.
     - **Deploy Stage**:
       - This can be optional for CI. However, if you want to deploy the built artifact:
       - Choose AWS CodeDeploy (for EC2 or on-premises) or Elastic Beanstalk.
       - Configure the deployment group to deploy the application.

4. **Set Up AWS CodeDeploy (Optional)**:
   - **Create a Deployment Group**:
     - Go to AWS CodeDeploy and create a new application.
     - Define a deployment group for your application.
     - Configure deployment settings, such as deployment type (in-place or blue/green) and environment (e.g., EC2 instances).

   - **AppSpec File**:
     - If using CodeDeploy, add an `appspec.yml` file to your repository to define how the application should be deployed.
     - Example `appspec.yml` for a Java application:
       ```yaml
       version: 0.0
       os: linux
       files:
         - source: target/myapp.jar
           destination: /opt/myapp
       hooks:
         AfterInstall:
           - location: scripts/start_server.sh
             timeout: 300
             runas: root
       ```

   **Explanation**:
   - **files**: Specifies the source file (built JAR) and the destination on the EC2 instance.
   - **hooks**: Defines scripts to run at specific points during the deployment lifecycle (e.g., after the application is installed).

5. **Set Up Automated Notifications (Optional)**:
   - **SNS or AWS Chatbot**:
     - You can configure AWS SNS or AWS Chatbot to send notifications to Slack, email, or other communication tools when pipeline events occur (e.g., build success or failure).
     - Set up a topic in SNS and configure the pipeline to publish events to this topic.

6. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - After the setup, trigger the pipeline manually or by pushing changes to the CodeCommit repository.
   - CodePipeline will automatically build, test, and (optionally) deploy the application based on the defined stages.

7. **Monitor and Review**:
   - **CodeBuild Logs**: Check build logs in CodeBuild for details on the build and test processes.
   - **CodePipeline**: Monitor the pipeline execution in CodePipeline.
   - **CodeDeploy**: If deploying, check the deployment status and logs in CodeDeploy.

<h1>Project Title: Re-Architecting a Multi-Tier Web Application for Azure Cloud-Native Environment</h1>

**Description**:
Led the re-architecting of a multi-tier web application to fully leverage Microsoft Azure's cloud-native services. The project transitioned from a traditional infrastructure to a modern, scalable, resilient, and cost-effective cloud-native architecture. This redesign utilized Azure's services such as Azure Functions, Azure API Management, Cosmos DB, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and more. The modernization effort enhanced performance, scalability, and resilience while reducing operational overhead.

**Technologies & Tools**:
- **Frontend**: React.js, Azure Blob Storage, Azure CDN
- **Backend**: Azure Functions, Azure API Management, Azure App Service, Node.js
- **Database**: Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates, Terraform
- **Orchestration & Containerization**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Azure Monitor, Azure Application Insights
- **CI/CD**: Azure DevOps (Pipelines, Repos, Artifacts)
- **Security**: Azure Security Center, Azure Active Directory (AAD), Azure Key Vault

**Key Features**:
- **Serverless Architecture**: Migrated core backend logic to Azure Functions, enabling automatic scaling and reducing the need for server management.
- **API Management**: Implemented Azure API Management to secure, publish, and analyze APIs, facilitating seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Managed Databases**: Replaced traditional relational databases with Cosmos DB for NoSQL storage and Azure SQL Database for transactional data, improving performance and scalability.
- **Containerization**: Deployed microservices in Docker containers managed by Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which handles provisioning, scaling, and management.
- **Static Content Delivery**: Moved static assets to Azure Blob Storage, with Azure CDN for global content delivery, ensuring low latency and high availability.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automated infrastructure provisioning using ARM Templates and Terraform, enabling version-controlled, repeatable deployments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a robust CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps, ensuring fast and reliable deployments.
- **Security Best Practices**: Implemented security measures like Azure Security Center for threat protection, AAD for identity management, and Azure Key Vault for managing secrets.

**Project Implementation**:

1. **Assessment and Planning**:
   - Conducted a detailed analysis of the existing application to identify components suitable for re-architecting using Azure cloud-native services.
   - Developed a migration and re-architecture strategy focused on breaking down the monolithic architecture into microservices and serverless components.

2. **Serverless Backend with Azure Functions**:
   - Refactored backend services to run as Azure Functions, enabling elastic scaling and reducing operational overhead.
   - Integrated Azure API Management to create a secure, scalable API gateway that handles routing, throttling, and monitoring of API calls.

3. **Database Modernization**:
   - Migrated data to Azure SQL Database for structured, relational data, and Cosmos DB for globally distributed NoSQL data.
   - Leveraged Cosmos DBâ€™s multi-region replication for high availability and low latency.

4. **Containerization and Microservices**:
   - Containerized legacy services using Docker and deployed them on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scalable, managed orchestration.
   - Decomposed the application into microservices, each running independently, improving maintainability and deployment flexibility.

5. **Static Content and CDN**:
   - Moved static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) to Azure Blob Storage and configured Azure CDN for fast, reliable content delivery globally.
   - Implemented lifecycle management policies in Azure Blob Storage to optimize storage costs.

6. **Infrastructure Automation**:
   - Defined and provisioned all Azure resources using ARM Templates and Terraform, ensuring consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments.
   - Managed infrastructure changes via Azure DevOps, enabling continuous delivery and automated rollbacks.

7. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Built a CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps, integrating automated testing, security scanning, and blue/green deployment strategies.
   - Ensured secure and efficient deployments across development, staging, and production environments.

8. **Monitoring and Optimization**:
   - Implemented Azure Monitor and Application Insights for real-time monitoring, logging, and diagnostics.
   - Used Azure Log Analytics to centralize logs and monitor microservices interactions, improving performance and reducing latency.

9. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Configured Azure Security Center to provide advanced threat protection and security recommendations.
   - Managed access control with Azure Active Directory (AAD) and secured secrets and certificates using Azure Key Vault.
   - Applied network security best practices with Azure Virtual Networks (VNets), Network Security Groups (NSGs), and Azure Firewall.

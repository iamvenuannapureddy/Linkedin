<h1>Project-12: Continuous Delivery on AWS Cloud (Java Application)</h1>

**Project Overview**:
In this project, we will build and deploy a Java application using a Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline on AWS Cloud. Continuous Delivery automates the process from code commit to deployment on AWS, ensuring fast and reliable releases. We will use AWS services such as **AWS CodePipeline**, **AWS CodeBuild**, **AWS CodeDeploy**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, or **Amazon ECS** to create a complete CD pipeline.

### **Project Architecture**:
- **AWS CodePipeline**: To orchestrate the entire CI/CD process.
- **AWS CodeBuild**: For building the Java application.
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: For automating deployments to AWS services.
- **Elastic Beanstalk / Amazon ECS (or EKS)**: For running the Java application in a scalable, managed environment.
- **GitHub/AWS CodeCommit**: As the source code repository.
- **Maven**: To build the Java project.
- **Docker**: If containerizing the application (for ECS/EKS).
- **Slack/SNS**: For deployment notifications.

### **Project Steps**:

#### **Step 1: Set Up Version Control (GitHub or AWS CodeCommit)**
- **Option 1: GitHub**:
  - Use GitHub as your source repository and integrate it with AWS CodePipeline.
  
- **Option 2: AWS CodeCommit**:
  - Set up an AWS CodeCommit repository to host your source code. 
  - Push your Java application code to the repository.

---

#### **Step 2: Set Up AWS CodePipeline for Continuous Delivery**
1. **Create CodePipeline in AWS**:
   - Navigate to the **AWS CodePipeline** service and create a new pipeline.
   - Choose a source provider (GitHub or CodeCommit) and select your repository and branch (e.g., `main`).
   
2. **Configure Build Stage**:
   - For the build stage, select **AWS CodeBuild**.
   - Create a new build project in CodeBuild and configure it to use **Maven** to build your Java application.

3. **Add a Build Specification File (`buildspec.yml`)**:
   - In the root of your repository, create a `buildspec.yml` file to define the build steps:

   ```yaml
   version: 0.2

   phases:
     install:
       commands:
         - echo Installing Maven...
         - mvn --version
     pre_build:
       commands:
         - echo Cleaning and installing dependencies...
         - mvn clean install
     build:
       commands:
         - echo Building the application...
         - mvn package
     post_build:
       commands:
         - echo Build completed successfully
         - mv target/*.jar ${CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR}
   
   artifacts:
     files:
       - target/*.jar
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - **install**: Checks for Maven installation.
   - **pre_build**: Cleans and installs project dependencies.
   - **build**: Packages the Java application into a `.jar` file.
   - **artifacts**: Specifies the output artifact (the JAR file) that will be used in the next pipeline stage.

---

#### **Step 3: Set Up Deployment Stage with AWS CodeDeploy**
1. **Option 1: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (for Java Web App)**:
   - **Elastic Beanstalk** provides a fully managed environment for deploying Java applications. You can either deploy the JAR/WAR file directly or use Docker if containerizing the application.
   - Create a new **Elastic Beanstalk** environment in AWS (select the appropriate platform, e.g., **Java SE**).
   
   - Add a new deployment stage in CodePipeline and choose **Elastic Beanstalk** as the deployment provider.
   - Configure Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the artifact (JAR/WAR) built by CodeBuild.

2. **Option 2: AWS ECS (for Containerized Java Applications)**:
   - **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)** allows you to deploy containerized applications. You need to containerize your Java app using Docker and push the Docker image to **Amazon ECR** (Elastic Container Registry).
   
   - Add a `Dockerfile` to your project:

     ```dockerfile
     FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
     COPY target/mywebapp.jar /usr/app/mywebapp.jar
     WORKDIR /usr/app
     EXPOSE 8080
     CMD ["java", "-jar", "mywebapp.jar"]
     ```

   - Modify the CodePipeline to include the following:
     - **AWS CodeBuild**: Configure CodeBuild to build and push Docker images to Amazon ECR.
     - **AWS ECS**: Add an ECS service as the deployment provider in CodePipeline. Use the newly pushed Docker image to update your ECS cluster.

   Example **buildspec.yml** for Docker:

   ```yaml
   version: 0.2

   phases:
     install:
       commands:
         - echo Installing dependencies...
         - $(aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1) | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
     pre_build:
       commands:
         - echo Building the Docker image...
         - docker build -t mywebapp .
         - docker tag mywebapp:latest <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mywebapp:latest
     build:
       commands:
         - echo Pushing Docker image to ECR...
         - docker push <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mywebapp:latest
   ```

   This pushes the Docker image to ECR, which ECS will use for deployment.

---

#### **Step 4: Continuous Testing and Approval**
1. **Add Automated Tests**:
   - Before deploying, run tests using **Maven** in the build stage of CodeBuild.
   
   - Update the `buildspec.yml` to include a testing phase:

   ```yaml
   pre_build:
     commands:
       - echo Running tests...
       - mvn test
   ```

2. **Manual Approval for Production Deployments** (Optional):
   - Add a manual approval action in CodePipeline before deploying to production.
   - This step will pause the pipeline and wait for a manual approval to proceed.

---

#### **Step 5: Notifications and Monitoring**
1. **AWS SNS/Slack Notifications**:
   - Set up an **AWS SNS Topic** for pipeline notifications, such as when a build or deployment succeeds or fails.
   - Subscribe to the SNS topic using email, SMS, or integrate it with **Slack**.

   You can use the `slack-notification-lambda` to send deployment updates directly to Slack channels.

2. **AWS CloudWatch**:
   - Monitor your application using **CloudWatch**. Set up custom alarms for application performance metrics such as CPU utilization, memory, or request errors.
   - You can integrate CloudWatch with Elastic Beanstalk or ECS to provide automatic scaling based on metrics.

---

#### **Step 6: Rollback Strategy**
1. **Automatic Rollback**:
   - Configure AWS CodeDeploy or ECS to automatically roll back to a previous working version in case of a failure.
   - For Elastic Beanstalk, enable the **Managed Updates** feature, which automatically deploys new versions and rolls back failed deployments.

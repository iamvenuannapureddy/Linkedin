<h1>Project Title: Lift and Shift: Migrating a Multi-Tier Web Application to AWS</h1>

**Lift and Shift to AWS** is a strategy for migrating an existing application to the cloud without redesigning or refactoring the application. The goal is to replicate your on-premise infrastructure in the cloud while leveraging the scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of AWS.

**Description**:
Successfully executed a **Lift and Shift** migration of a multi-tier web application from an on-premise environment to AWS. The migration involved transferring a complex stack that includes a React.js frontend, Node.js backend, MySQL and MongoDB databases, NGINX as a web server, Apache Tomcat as an application server, Memcached for caching, and RabbitMQ for messaging. The entire setup was orchestrated using Vagrant locally, then seamlessly migrated to AWS services, ensuring minimal downtime and maximizing cloud benefits.

**Technologies & Tools**:

- **Frontend**: React.js, S3, CloudFront
  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk
  
- **Database**: RDS (MySQL), MongoDB Atlas
  
- **Web Server**: NGINX on EC2
  
- **Application Server**: Apache Tomcat on EC2
  
- **Caching**: Elasticache (Memcached)
  
- **Message Queuing**: Amazon MQ (RabbitMQ)
  
- **Infrastructure Management**: Vagrant, AWS CloudFormation, AWS CLI, Terraform

**Key Features**:
- **Seamless Migration**: Lift and Shift approach used to migrate the entire application stack to AWS, with minimal changes to the application code.
  
- **AWS Services Integration**: Utilized AWS EC2 for compute resources, RDS for MySQL, MongoDB Atlas for NoSQL data, Elasticache for caching, and Amazon MQ for message queuing.
  
- **Scalability and Performance**: Leveraged AWS Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and CloudFront CDN to enhance application performance and scalability.
  
- **Security and Compliance**: Implemented best practices for securing AWS resources using VPC, IAM roles, security groups, and SSL/TLS encryption.
  
- **Cost Optimization**: Analyzed and optimized AWS resource utilization to ensure cost-effective operation.

**Project Implementation**:

1. **Preparation and Assessment**:
   - Conducted a thorough assessment of the existing infrastructure to identify the components and dependencies for migration.
   - Created a migration plan outlining the steps for replicating the on-premise environment in AWS.

2. **Infrastructure Setup on AWS**:
   - **Compute**: Deployed EC2 instances to host the web and application servers (NGINX, Apache Tomcat) and backend services (Node.js, Express).
   - **Database**: Migrated MySQL database to AWS RDS and MongoDB to MongoDB Atlas.
   - **Web Server**: Configured NGINX on an EC2 instance to act as a reverse proxy and serve static content.
   - **Application Server**: Deployed Apache Tomcat on an EC2 instance for running Java applications.
   - **Caching**: Set up Elasticache with Memcached for caching frequently accessed data.
   - **Message Queuing**: Used Amazon MQ to run RabbitMQ for managing message queues.

3. **Data Migration**:
   - **Database Migration**: Migrated MySQL databases to AWS RDS using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) and MongoDB databases to MongoDB Atlas using native tools.
   - **File System Migration**: Transferred static assets and media files to S3, using CloudFront as the CDN for global content delivery.

4. **Networking and Security**:
   - Configured AWS VPC to isolate resources and manage network traffic securely.
   - Set up security groups, NACLs, and IAM roles to enforce security best practices.
   - Used Route 53 for DNS management and SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS access.

5. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Conducted extensive testing to ensure the migrated application functions correctly in the AWS environment.
   - Optimized AWS resource allocation for cost efficiency and performance.

6. **Go-Live and Monitoring**:
   - Executed the final cutover to the AWS environment, ensuring minimal downtime.
   - Implemented monitoring and alerting using AWS CloudWatch and other third-party tools to monitor application health and performance.

<h1>Project Title: Re-Architecting a Multi-Tier Web Application for AWS Cloud-Native Environment</h1>

**Description**:

Led the re-architecting of a multi-tier web application to fully leverage AWS's cloud-native services. Transitioned from a traditional infrastructure to a scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient cloud-native architecture. The project involved redesigning the application to utilize AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Aurora, S3, ECS, and more. This modernization effort not only improved performance and scalability but also enhanced the application's resilience and reduced operational overhead.

**Technologies & Tools**:

- **Frontend**: React.js, S3, CloudFront
  
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Node.js, ECS (Fargate)
  
- **Database**: Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Aurora
  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CloudFormation, Terraform
  
- **Orchestration & Containerization**: AWS ECS (Fargate)
  
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray
  
- **CI/CD**: AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy
  
- **Security**: AWS WAF, IAM, AWS KMS, Secrets Manager
  

**Key Features**:

- **Serverless Architecture**: Migrated core backend logic to AWS Lambda, reducing the need for server management and enabling automatic scaling.
  
- **API Gateway**: Designed and implemented a RESTful API using AWS API Gateway to route requests to Lambda functions, providing a scalable and secure interface for frontend communication.
  
- **Managed Databases**: Replaced traditional relational databases with Amazon Aurora for transactional data and DynamoDB for NoSQL storage, improving performance and scalability.
  
- **Containerization**: Deployed microservices in Docker containers managed by Amazon ECS (Fargate), which handles provisioning, scaling, and management.
  
- **Static Content Delivery**: Moved static assets to S3, with CloudFront for global content delivery, ensuring low latency and high availability.
  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automated infrastructure provisioning using AWS CloudFormation and Terraform, enabling version-controlled, repeatable deployments.
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a robust CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, ensuring fast and reliable deployments.
  
- **Security Best Practices**: Implemented security measures like AWS WAF for protection against web attacks, IAM roles for fine-grained access control, and AWS KMS for encryption.
  

**Project Implementation**:

1. **Assessment and Planning**:
   
   - Conducted a thorough analysis of the existing application to identify components suitable for re-architecting using cloud-native services.
     
   - Planned the migration strategy, focusing on breaking down the monolithic architecture into microservices and serverless components.
     

2. **Serverless Backend with AWS Lambda**:
   
   - Refactored the backend code to run as Lambda functions, enabling automatic scaling and reducing operational complexity.
     
   - Connected Lambda functions to AWS API Gateway to create RESTful APIs, enabling secure and efficient communication with the frontend.
     

3. **Database Modernization**:
   
   - Migrated relational data to Amazon Aurora, benefiting from automated backups, snapshots, and replication.
     
   - Re-architected parts of the application to use DynamoDB for high-throughput, low-latency access to NoSQL data.
     

4. **Containerization and Microservices**:
   
   - Containerized legacy services and deployed them on AWS ECS (Fargate) for scalable and managed container orchestration.
     
   - Decomposed the application into microservices to improve maintainability, scalability, and deployment flexibility.
     

5. **Static Content and CDN**:
   
   - Moved static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) to S3 and configured CloudFront as the CDN for fast global delivery.
     
   - Implemented S3 lifecycle policies to manage storage costs effectively.
     

6. **Infrastructure Automation**:
    
   - Used CloudFormation and Terraform to define and provision all AWS resources, ensuring consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployment.
     
   - Managed infrastructure changes via version control, enabling automated rollbacks and consistent environment setup across development, staging, and production.
     

7. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    
   - Built a CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline, integrating CodeBuild for automated testing and CodeDeploy for blue/green deployments, minimizing downtime during updates.
     
   - Integrated security and compliance checks into the pipeline to ensure adherence to best practices and organizational policies.
     

8. **Monitoring and Optimization**:
    
   - Implemented CloudWatch for logging, metrics, and alarms, providing real-time visibility into application performance and operational health.
     
   - Used AWS X-Ray to trace and debug microservices interactions, improving performance and reducing latency.

9. **Security Enhancements**:
    
   - Configured AWS WAF to protect against common web attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
     
   - Used IAM roles and policies to enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring secure access to AWS resources.
     
   - Managed sensitive information using AWS Secrets Manager and encrypted data at rest using AWS KMS.

<h2>Project Title: Automated Multi-Tier Web Application Deployment Using Vagrant and Advanced Stack</h2>

**Description**:
Designed and deployed a multi-tier web application leveraging a robust stack that includes Vagrant for environment management, MySQL and MongoDB for databases, NGINX and Apache Tomcat for web and application serving, Memcached for caching, RabbitMQ for message queuing, and VSCode for development. The project was automated using Vagrant to provision and configure multiple virtual machines, demonstrating end-to-end full-stack development and DevOps practices.

**Technologies & Tools**:

- **Frontend**: React.js
  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Java with Apache Tomcat
  
- **Database**: MySQL, MongoDB
  
- **Web Server**: NGINX
  
- **Application Server**: Apache Tomcat
  
- **Caching**: Memcached

- **Message Queuing**: RabbitMQ
  
- **Development Environment**: VSCode

- **Provisioning & Automation**: Vagrant, VirtualBox

  
**Key Features**:
- **Vagrant for Environment Management**: Used Vagrant to create and configure multiple virtual machines, each responsible for a specific tier of the application (frontend, backend, databases, caching, etc.).
  
- **Multi-Database Setup**: Integrated MySQL for relational data and MongoDB for NoSQL, handling different data storage needs.
  
- **Web & Application Servers**: Deployed NGINX as a reverse proxy for load balancing and Apache Tomcat to serve Java-based applications.
  
- **Caching & Message Queuing**: Implemented Memcached to enhance application performance and RabbitMQ to manage messaging between services.
  
- **Full Automation**: Automated the setup and configuration of the entire stack using Vagrant, ensuring that the environment can be reproduced easily on any machine.
  
- **VSCode Integration**: Set up a development environment using VSCode with extensions and settings pre-configured for the stack.

**Project Implementation**:

1. **Vagrant Configuration**:
   - Created a `Vagrantfile` to define multiple virtual machines:
     - **Web Server VM**: Runs NGINX and serves static content.
     - **App Server VM**: Hosts Apache Tomcat for Java applications.
     - **Database VM**: Hosts both MySQL and MongoDB.
     - **Cache & Queue VM**: Runs Memcached and RabbitMQ.
   - Provisioned each VM with the necessary software, using shell scripts to automate the installation and configuration process.

2. **Multi-Tier Application Setup**:
   - **Frontend**: Developed in React.js, served by NGINX.
   - **Backend**: Node.js API integrated with MySQL and MongoDB, hosted on Apache Tomcat for Java applications.
   - **Databases**: MySQL for relational data and MongoDB for document-based data.
   - **Cache & Messaging**: Integrated Memcached for caching API responses and RabbitMQ for processing asynchronous tasks.

3. **Automation & DevOps**:
   - Used Vagrant to create a reproducible development environment, ensuring that all team members have identical setups.
   - Set up automated deployment scripts to initialize and configure all services upon `vagrant up`.
   - Implemented monitoring and logging for each service to ensure high availability and performance.
